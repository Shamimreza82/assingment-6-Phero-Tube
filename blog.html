                <h1 class="font-bold text-xl">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1> <br>
                <p class="">Var variable is a function- scoped, If var variable is declared outside of any function it become a global variable and can be accessed throughout the entire program. Var are hoisted their declarations are moved to the top of the enclosing function or global scope. <br> <br>
                    Let variable is a block- scoped, Let redefined within its scope but cannot be re-declared within its scope. <br> <br>
                    const variable is a block- scoped, ‘const’ cannot be redefined or re-declared within its scope.

                <h1 class="font-bold text-xl">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1> <br>
                <p class=""><strong>Use Cases of null:</strong>  Functions can return null to indicate that they didn't produce a valid result or encountered an error during execution. its initialize a variable with the value null to indicate that it doesn't currently hold any meaningful value. Set an object property to null to indicate that the property exists but doesn't have a value. <br>
                   <strong> Use Cases of undefined: </strong>  Declare a variable without assigning a value to it, it is automatically initialized with the value undefined. Use to function parameter is not provided with a value during a function call it is set to undefined.

                <h1 class="font-bold text-xl">What do you mean by REST API?</h1> <br>
                <p class=""> REST API is a way of easily accessing web services without having excess processing. Whenever a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource. An API is an application programming interface. It’s a set of rules that allow programs to communicate with each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it.REST is what determines how the API looks. It is the rules that developers follow when they create an API. One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data (a resource) when you link to a specific URL.</p>
